Brilliant, blue butterflies!
Big box, small bag.
Bat flies by the sun.
Bet on the best horse.
Bus stops near the bay.
Bed is warm at night.
Bib on, baby eats now.
Bog was deep and dark.
Bow to the kind baron.
Bid high for the art.
Bun with butter is tasty.
Bug crawled under the log.
Bot made a quick move.
Bad luck struck again.
Bar was crowded last night.
Bay waters looked peaceful.
Bit by bit, he learned.
Bin was full of paper.
Bag fell off the chair.
Bud blossomed into a flower.
Bot and bus waited outside.
